## üìà Compression Logic

The video compression feature reduces the file size by approximately 50% while maintaining a good balance of quality. The compression works as follows:

- The **FFmpeg** tool is used to compress the video by adjusting the bitrate and quality settings.
- The target size for the compressed video is set to 50% of the original size.
- The compression process also ensures the video is encoded with the **libx264** codec and the audio with the **AAC** codec for optimal compatibility.

For detailed information, refer to the `compress_video` function in the `compressor.py` file.
